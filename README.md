#  Movie Review Sentiment Analysis

##  Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing the **sentiment** of movie reviews using machine learning techniques. By classifying user reviews as **positive** or **negative**, we can gain insights into audience reception and build tools for feedback analysis in the entertainment industry.

The project includes preprocessing raw text, feature extraction using TF-IDF, and training multiple classifiers to determine the best-performing sentiment analyzer.

##  Objectives

- Clean and preprocess movie reviews
- Convert raw text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF
- Train and compare ML models (Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM)
- Visualize results and metrics
- Deploy as a user-friendly app (optional)

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset

- **Source**: [IMDb Movie Reviews Dataset](https://ai.stanford.edu/~amaas/data/sentiment/)
- **Type**: Binary Sentiment Classification
- **Size**: 50,000 labeled reviews
  - 25,000 for training (balanced)
  - 25,000 for testing (balanced)
- **Labels**:
  - `1` â€“ Positive
  - `0` â€“ Negative

---

##  Technologies Used

- **Python**
  - `pandas`, `numpy` â€“ data handling
  - `nltk`, `re`, `string` â€“ text preprocessing
  - `scikit-learn` â€“ machine learning models and metrics
  - `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `wordcloud` â€“ visualization

##  Project Workflow

1. **Data Loading**
   - Import and merge datasets
   - Assign sentiment labels

2. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopword filtering
   - Lemmatization

3. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer for text representation

4. **Model Training**
   - Train Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Support Vector Machine
   - Evaluate using Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix

5. **Visualization**
   - Word Clouds for positive/negative reviews
   - Confusion matrices and classification reports

##  Results

| Model                 | Accuracy |
|----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression  | 88.7%    |
| Naive Bayes          | 86.2%    |
| Support Vector Classifier | 89.4%    |

- **Best Performing Model**: SVM
- Word clouds showed that negative reviews often included words like *boring, worst*, while positive ones had *amazing, brilliant, loved*.
